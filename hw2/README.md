HW2 - METEOR implementation

As the base method, I implemented simple METEOR method. I did some preprocessing over the data, such as removing all the punctuations. Also, as an extension I calculated the matched bigrams and trigrams in addition to unigrams (adding 4-grams had an oppisite result). 

Furthermore, I extracted n-gram (1<=n<=5) features form hypothesis sentences in order to apply classification methods. But, the results were not promissing. My main concern is extracting helpful features which needs more attention.
